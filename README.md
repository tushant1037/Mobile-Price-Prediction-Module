# Mobile-Price-Prediction-Module
Using machine learning Mobile price prediction module of given dataset

I used here TKinter python library to make user interface. It is very easy and useful library to build user interface for Desktop applications.

Screenshots of interface are in Screenshots folder.

I use Linear regression algorithm which code is in lr_module.py folder.

I use Decision Tree algorithm which code is in dt_module.py folder.

I use K-Nearest-Neighbour algorithm which code is in knn_module.py folder.
